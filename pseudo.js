// Things we want:
// 1. array of things that make you smile
// 2. use for loop to create buttons with text of each emotion in array
// 3. each button on click will display an array of gifs that were called from giphy API
// 		- each new click will wipe out old gifs and generate new results per button
// 4. input to add another emotion button that will have same click functionality.


// ARRAY OF SMILE THINGS : puppies, kittens, babies, laughter, hugs
